MyCustonAudioDAC

Idid make a custom Usb Audio card with Xmos, Was a faild project since it was a incorrect sice of a Inductor. 
// Warning, don't use this a referance, you need to fix the Inductor size. 
// The card did work, with an external buck converter, "cheaper to use a external buck converter" 

A remake of this card is in progress, Need to make it compatible with Other hardware than USB 2.0
